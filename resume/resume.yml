  brief: 'An articulate and analytical Engineer who has been able to adapt to working in different areas without compromising performance. I have worked on a variety of projects from simple to complex while working towards a tight deadline in an agile manner. Within my roles I have analysed, developed, tested and deployed onto different systems within a continuous integration environment. In addition to this I have ran user acceptance testing for any customer facing clients. During my years I have proven my communication skills by effectively communicating with both the business and technical sides. I have shown to have strong technical skills while performing as a server-side Java Developer and a willingness to learn new ones which is exhibited by my transition to a DevOps Engineer.'
