The underpinning idea behind all this is to have the infrastructure as code and be able to bring it up/down with automation. With having minimal exposure to infrastructure, I have been able to pick up the tech stack quickly and effectivly and have provided a major contribution to the project by re-implementing the Jenkins jobs as pipelines written in groovy."

      "summary": "While at Capgemini I was part of an agile team within the Applied Innovation Exchange (AIE), my role was to develop a proof of concept based on emerging tech to demo in front of clients. During the sprints I was able to demonstrate my knowledge and technical skills for developing new software by picking up new technology and hitting the ground the running. My first project was to develop a feedback system utilising Intel's depth sensing camera which allows a user to provide positive or negative feedback based on hand recognition. The use of this was based on the need to provide a quick and easy way for a business to gauge feedback from their customers or employees. The application was built using Core Java, Java Swing and Maven on top of Intel's SDK which provided the Dynamically Linked Libraries for the camera. Another project I was part of was to create an IoT car which is able to send an event as a response for when it crashes. The case behind this was to have a proof of concept of utilising IoT devices to send useful data. The hardware consisted of a sensor integrated with a Raspberry Pi and placed within a remote controlled car. Using Python and Node-Red I was able to send live sensor data to IBMs Watson IoT platform to visualise the live data feed. By fitting an algorithmic model to the sensor data my team were able to recognise a crash and send a notification to a REST API. On my final project I lead a team to develop a biometrics check-in system as part of a web app, the system was able to recognise a person's face and log them into the system. This was possible using Microsoft Cognitive Services for the algorithmic detection and interpreting the data returned. As this was a Greenfield project, I believed it would be best to challenge ourselves and use ReactJS."

      "summary": "WMy role at British Airways was to optimise the website by introducing live bug fixes and improvements into its release cycle. During my time I dealt with a large variation of issues which occurred across all areas of the site including its various subsystems. By using the tools available to me, I would analyse an issue based from the user story and pinpoint where the problem occurred and create a future proof solution. The team I was part of was responsible for a major migration to replace the websites API calls with WebServices, this involved creating an extensive testing plan alongside the code changes. During my downtime between tasks, I would go out of my way to develop automation scripts which would increase my productivity and that of the teams. As well as providing support for the optimisation team, I gave assistance to analyse, test and integrate a 3rd party tool that would help to monitor the website. During this time I advised in the feasibility and limitations of the tool, from both the user perspective and back-end perspective."
