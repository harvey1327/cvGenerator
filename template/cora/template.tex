    An articulate and analytical Engineer who has been able to adapt to working in different areas without compromising performance. I have worked on a variety of projects from simple to complex while working towards a tight deadline in an agile manner. Within my roles I have analysed, developed, tested and deployed onto different systems within a continuous integration/delivery environment. During my years I have proven my communication skills by effectively communicating with both the business and technical sides of the company. I have shown to have strong technical skills while performing as a backend developer and a willingness to learn new ones which is exhibited by my roles as a FullStack/DevOps Engineer. \par

    {\textbf{2022-Jul - Present}} \par
    At Fujitsu I have been part of multiple teams which have focused on developing a product for the long term and providing services to our clients for the short term. The long term project was to develop a contactless ticketing system mobile application to allow customers to travel via public transport. This was developed using Java and the Spring Boot framework, it is based on an Event Driven microservice architecture utilising RabbitMQ, alongside this the front end is written in typescript using the Angular framework \par
    {\textbf{HIGHLIGHTS}} \par
    \begin{itemize}[label={\large\textbullet}]
      \item Improved the sprint planning process by streamlining the scope of tickets and how they are created
      \item Collaborated with other senior engineers to push forward the mentality to tackle tech debt as we implement new features
      \item Mentored junior developers to use best practice when developing new features or refactoring
      \item Communicated with the client to identify and solve production issues
      \item Collaborated with developers and the client to understand how to develop CI/CD pipelines during a migration
    \end{itemize}

    My role here was to design and develop the analytics and front end services from the ground up. The goal was to have a platform where large amounts of data could be ingested and processed with various metrics being calculated and shown on a dashboard to a user. The platform was designed on a microservices architecture hosted on GCP \par
    {\textbf{HIGHLIGHTS}} \par
    \begin{itemize}[label={\large\textbullet}]
      \item Worked with a variety of modern technologies: Go, Typescript, Node, React, GraphQL, gRPC, Docker, Google Cloud Platform
      \item Designed and developed the microservice architecture the platform is based on. Using a combination of Go built services using gRPC for service-service communication and a Node GraphQL service to communicate to our front end in React
      \item Using Gitlab Pipelines and Github Actions I developed our CI/CD process to deploy our services to GCP CloudRun after it had tested the code and build/pushed a Docker image to GCP Container Registry. This enabled us to have a consistent and reliable approach to deploy to dev and production
      \item Automated creation of GCP infrastructure services and accounts using the gcloud sdk
      \item Was able to pick up and use Go competently and made good use of Goroutines when it was required for metric and data processing or streaming data between services
      \item Implemented RBAC using Auth0 within GraphQL to enable authentication across multiple roles on a public api
    \end{itemize}
