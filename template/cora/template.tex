    An articulate and analytical Engineer who has been able to adapt to working in different areas without compromising performance. I have worked on a variety of projects from simple to complex while working towards a tight deadline in an agile manner. Within my roles I have analysed, developed, tested and deployed onto different systems within a continuous integration/delivery environment. During my years I have proven my communication skills by effectively communicating with both the business and technical sides of the company. I have shown to have strong technical skills while performing as a backend developer and a willingness to learn new ones which is exhibited by my roles as a FullStack/DevOps Engineer. \par
